ARDiS
===================

ARDiS is a python library that aims at simulating reaction-diffusion systems with the FEM, a method known for its high numerical precision especially in difficult shapes

A paper detailing the scope, goals, and performances of ARDiS are detailed in a paper that has been published in the Micromachines journal. It is available at:
